## Draft

**Motivation/Problem/Opportunity**

I have designed a few issues of the magazine â€“ all printed versions. There is a need for a digital version now, as it does not fulfil its potential in its current state and does not represent the university or its students properly.

**Thesis**

The students' magazine is now only published in a printed version. Students do not seek out online versions of magazines. Yet, many of them stated digital format as preferred for consuming content. Thus, digital magazines have the potential to become more appealing to readers, by creating a new standard practice. Focusing on better online readability and displaying as well as easy production may achieve that.

**Approach/Methodology**

Studying different students' magazines and online magazines in general. How are they designed, published and what technology are they using. Exploring trends in online publishing, with a focus on the usage of interactive elements for better readability. Interviewing students about their habits in consuming online content.

**Background Research/Literature Review**

There are papers discussing the future of magazine form and so, though they offer no applicable tested practices. Still, said papers serve as a theoretical basis for designers and magazine publishers. The discussion tends to sway away from developing digital publishing quite often, due to persistent conflict between print and digital. In an attempt to find out which format is superior and thus more desirable for readers, there is a lack of effort to develop both formats. This stagnates the whole process.

**Results/Outcomes/Analysis**

There is no standardised practice in digital publishing, which would make digital magazines appealing. Moreover, would ease the production of both formats, which would allow better work-flow and publishing.

**Conclusion**

The goal is an easy production method of print and digital magazines, in which none is superior to the other. Also, in which the digital version is not lacking in usability. Trying to make the first step to improve digital publishing will make digital magazines more accessible. Moreover, it will attract readers who already appreciate the convenience of digital media. For others, it can present a new way of consuming content. This has the potential to create more opportunities for publishing houses, as it keeps up with today's technologies and trends.
