# Review

1. What did you like most about this subject?

I really appreaciated how the focus is on us as designers + seeing more of my classmates. Also, the very warm and supportive approach (I can imagine how hard that was, especially when it wasn't always returned with the same enthusiasm).

2. What did you like least about this subject?

Sometimes it felt very challenging to deliver content weekly.

3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?

Well.. using github (just kidding). 
 - There's so much cool stuff on the internet (ty for the resources and hot links!)
 - being more proud of things you've done and that you like â€“ small or big
 - it's rewarding to trying out new things and tools even if the outcome is not perfect *(yet)*

and of course, content first!

4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?

Storytelling for sure.

5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?

I showed my work in progress a little bit more and opened myself to feedback that way (it's more convenient to submit the work last minute, since then I do not have to/can't revise). And writing more!

6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?

When I do not have to, I simply *won't* make a basic slide presentation. Also, when unsupervised, I really complicate things. 
*(And I can't stop writing "readibility" instead of "readability".)*


7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?

I'd like to have it for the whole 3 years, thank you.


8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?

Embrace more the fact that not everything I do have to be perfect and groundbreaking, and not everyone has to like it either.


9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?

I'm trying really hard to think of something-


10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?

Don't be shy to show your work in progress, even though it may be intimidating.
