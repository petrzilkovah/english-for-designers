# Voice
I tend to have problem to grasp properly what is being told to me when the speaker doesn't make connections, so i try my best to make my presentations really hard to NOT understand. Have to keep in mind to not overdo it, so the people doesn't get the impression that I think they are dumb. I also often get really cought up in my speaking so I pay attention and be aware of my audience and make myself approachable. It's not just about me.
