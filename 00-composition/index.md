# The art of *creating* and *understanding* instructions
The goal of the following warm-up exercise is to try and master using language (written word to be exact) for transferring a piece of information. Working in teams, everyone will write down instructions for a picture, so a different team would be able to recreate the picture just by following these instructions. Everyone will participate in creating instructions, as well as following instructions made by others. 
### the original instructions

### *updated* instructions
- The center of this object is a small circle
- There are 6 lines coming from the **outline** of the circle, all of them are about the same length
    1. the first line is pointing to the North and has a triangle at the end (this makes the line look like an arrow). The triangle is *filled in black*
    2. the second line is pointing to the East and also has a black triangle at the end
    3. the third line is pointing to the South-East and also has a black triangle at the end
    4. the fourth line is pointing South. There's no triangle at the end
    5. the fifth line is pointing to the west, also no triangle
    6. the sixth line is pointing North-West, also no triangle
- There is **no crossing visible** inside the circle, it's just white

Preferably, the result would look like a clock with too many clock hands. 
(Or maybe a compass, idk)

### *result*
It all went well because we are very smart kids.
