## my story

I'm your average diversity-in-everything enjoyer. I like my coffee sugary and creamy, like my music, and I like my coffee bitter, also like my music. I like to consume, create, combine and learn as much as I can in the process. *Previous statement can apply to food and/or any media.* 

Given my artistic background, I lean towards illustration and lively design. I still find joy in clean and minimalistic stuff, though. Driven to make things <s>pretty</s> work. *At any cost. Not in a rule-breaking way, but definitely a rule-bending way.*

Don't you worry I wouldn't know a way to do something, I'm experienced in making my own ways. Right now I'm on a journey to cultivate an unusual ordinary design.
