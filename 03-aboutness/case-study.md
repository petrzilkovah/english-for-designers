# Povstalec - VŠKK students magazine
## Magazine making from 0 to 100 (or 50) in a month.
This design project was completely accidential on my part, and I'm very grateful for it. It concerns VŠKK students magazine (at the time i didn't know we have a magazine), which lost the graphic designer last minute and the editorial office was looking for a designer who would help them put together the newest issue (VERY quickly). 

"Hey, that sounds like a great deal" - said me, a graphic design student unexperienced in magazine making, who was avoiding working in InDesign at any cost. So I set up a meeting with editor in chief and regardless of any concerns about my abilities, I started working.

Since the editorial office of the magazine consist exclusively of literature students, all of the design choices and technical processing is now laying on my shoulders. Also, I can't simply follow the layout of the last published issue, because there were too many problems and things the editorial office wasn't satisfied with (such as readability, color scheme, layout, use of photos...). So I consulted with my teachers and little by little begun to creating the magazine from scratch.

Time was tight and you can't always wait for your designer to learn how to use grid correctly. Especially when they already have to figure out basic layouts, type and how to even use InDesign tools. **Priorities.**
