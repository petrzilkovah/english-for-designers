# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester:

1. Use github, got a hang of markdown and actively use its tools
3. Gain more confidence in my writing
4. Prioritize content above format
5. Asking the question 'Why do I do design?' (I don't have an answer yet, but just asking is alright atm) 
6. Seek more accessibility in the way I do design

*... and better CV*
