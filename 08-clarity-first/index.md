## Key Points


1. Background/importance of topic:
    - I've already designed a few issues of the magazine – all printed versions. There's a need for a digital version now, 1. for a better representation of the school and 2. for enriching my skill set as a designer.
2. Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of problem): 
    - The students' magazine is now only published in a printed version. That's is not adequate for the school standards (and today's trends) and thus does not fulfil its potential.
3. Research — design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations:
    - Studying different students' magazines and online magazines in general. How are they designed, published and what technology are they using. I'm asking for observations and ideas of other students who are my target group – usually by verbal dialogue. Then figuring out their habits in consuming online content and taking them into account.
5. Findings (highlight outcome of research):
6. Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society):

**THE PROBLEM**

Students' magazine I design is now only published in printed version, which is a shame because it's not fulfilling its potential. (as a students' magazine published at "creative communication" university)

**THE ACTIONS**

I looked up other students' magazines and online magazines in general, what technology they use, how they are designed etc. I also dived a little more into online publishing and also talking with other student at our school - to see how they view our magazine and what they would change.

**SUCCESS?**

*... well hopefully*
the best outcome would be that more students would read and maybe even contribute to our magazine - and for me to gain more understanding and experience in online publishing, because I think it's cool to know (and useful).
